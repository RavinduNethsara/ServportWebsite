                <h2>LITERATURE SURVEY</h2>
                In the service business, customer happiness is a critical factor in determining a company's success. In order to remain competitive in this market, businesses must work hard to both acquire new consumers and keep their current ones happy. According to several research studies, an increase in firm
                performance is directly linked to improved customer satisfaction, according to several research [11]. It will
                eventually bring in much money. As a result, improving customer retention and decreasing customer churn requires a
                keen eye on consumer behavior [12]. It is more cost-effective to keep current customers than to
                bring in new ones when it comes to client retention. As a word originated from customer behavior theory, loyalty indicates how customers view services, activities, and brands [13].
                Loyalty is a two-fold concept with behavioral and cognitive components. A customer's intention to buy again, switch brands, or donate money to a charity is their behavioral intent. Cognitive is more relevant to customer preferences and
                recommendations for industry [14]. In order to keep a customer, it is critical that they are happy with their purchase. According to the study, independent
                variables such as customer service and price justice play a significant role in making customers happy. It is important to note that each independent variable influences the dependent
                variable in this case. Your business will benefit significantly from delighted customers, who will promote positive wordof-mouth about your brand and help build your brand's reputation. [15] The long-term relationship between the brand
                and its delighted customers will be mutually beneficial. Customer satisfaction varies between industries and
                countries for a variety of reasons. For a VietinBank, a study in Vietnam uncovered fifteen elements that influence customer
                happiness. Website and app performance, personalization, engagement in real-time, and mobility are just a few of these considerations [16]. Customers' pleasure with their online
                buying experience is influenced by various factors, including the quality of the goods, the brand, and the shopping experience itself [17]. The quality of the cuisine, the quality
                of the service, and the restaurant's environment all have a role in customer satisfaction, according to a recent Pakistani
                journal publication [18]. Several elements affect customer satisfaction in the automobile service industry. An investigation was carried out
                in vehicle service facilities by J. Hong and B. Kim found that customer happiness is influenced by service quality, long-term relationships and relationship advantages, and customer
                satisfaction and trust [19]. According to C.Randhawa, a model he developed expands on Yee and Faziharudean's thesis that
                service quality, preserved value, trust, habit, reputation, and servicescape affect customer satisfaction [20][21]. Considering all these points, efforts have been made to
                develop an effective prediction model to predict whether the customer will retain or churn and its impact on company
                profitability considering factors affecting customer satisfaction. Because customer retention will vary depending
                on the identified factors affecting for customer satisfaction. Typically, the service center will suggest the next service
                date based on the kilometers traveled. However, customers often forget, or it may be changed depending on the type of
                used engine oil and the vehicle's condition. As technology advances on a daily basis, progressing with technology is
                more beneficial for any industry. As a solution, machine learning methods were chosen to predict the next service date in the 'Servport' vehicle service
                management system using a proper dataset. Numerous variables can be used to predict the next scheduled service date. The primary factors include the type of service, the cost
                of the service, time taken for the service, the average vehicle usage, and the year the vehicle was manufactured.
                Additionally, the system was developed using a vehicle service history dataset from a reputed vehicle service center in
                Sri Lanka. After predicting the next service date, the system will notify customers via email of the service date and
                estimated price. Predicting the next service date benefits not just the consumer, but also the company. It may also be used as a sales
                technique to encourage customers to return for their next car servicing. Additionally, it results in forming a bond between the customer and the company.
                Vehicle repair shops are also seriously researching ways to cut down on idle time for their employees. The waste of raw
                materials must also be reduced. In addition, the raw materials used daily will have an impact. As a result, client satisfaction
                will be lowered. The magazine produced by the IEOM Society International stresses the importance of anticipating employee performance [22].
                Predicting the future is becoming increasingly important in the modern corporate sector because of the rapid changes that affect even the most established structures and the need
                for precise and realistic measured values into the future. It is a sign of survival and the language of business in the world that
                forecasts are made. When predicting the future, forecasting is both art and science. The most frequently occurring variable is a person's desire for a product or service. The supply and
                pricing of a product can also play a role [23]. Predicting future values of variables under study is known
                as forecasting. Demand and price forecasting have been the subject of several investigations. Product pricing and demand are typically predicted using historical data. In Mauritius,
                prices were predicted but have since changed. Comparing the prediction results of different technologies demonstrated that the cost of these solutions might be pretty comparable. It was
                discovered that the critical algorithm and method could not classify and predict numerical values. According to the
                findings of this study, a small sample size did not yield good prediction precision. [24]. Considerations such as these must be considered before a
                company selects a forecasting strategy that works best for it. Qualitative, time series, causal, and simulation forecasting
                approaches are examples of this method [25]. Time series analysis relies on the features of the demand time series to anticipate accurately. Stable and periodic
                patterns in transition curves resulted in high predicting accuracies; irregular patterns resulted in lower forecasting accuracy. [26].

      "<h2>LITERATURE SURVEY</h2> In the service business, customer happiness is a critical factor in determining a company's success. In order to remain competitive in this market, businesses must work hard to both acquire new consumers and keep their current ones happy. According to several research studies, an increase in firm performance is directly linked to improved customer satisfaction, according to several research [11]. It will eventually bring in much money. As a result, improving customer retention and decreasing customer churn requires a keen eye on consumer behavior [12]. It is more cost-effective to keep current customers than to bring in new ones when it comes to client retention. As a word originated from customer behavior theory, loyalty indicates how customers view services, activities, and brands [13]. Loyalty is a two-fold concept with behavioral and cognitive components. A customer's intention to buy again, switch brands, or donate money to a charity is their behavioral intent. Cognitive is more relevant to customer preferences and recommendations for industry [14]. In order to keep a customer, it is critical that they are happy with their purchase. According to the study, independent variables such as customer service and price justice play a significant role in making customers happy. It is important to note that each independent variable influences the dependent variable in this case. Your business will benefit significantly from delighted customers, who will promote positive wordof-mouth about your brand and help build your brand's reputation. [15] The long-term relationship between the brand and its delighted customers will be mutually beneficial. Customer satisfaction varies between industries and countries for a variety of reasons. For a VietinBank, a study in Vietnam uncovered fifteen elements that influence customer happiness. Website and app performance, personalization, engagement in real-time, and mobility are just a few of these considerations [16]. Customers' pleasure with their online buying experience is influenced by various factors, including the quality of the goods, the brand, and the shopping experience itself [17]. The quality of the cuisine, the quality of the service, and the restaurant's environment all have a role in customer satisfaction, according to a recent Pakistani journal publication [18]. Several elements affect customer satisfaction in the automobile service industry. An investigation was carried out in vehicle service facilities by J. Hong and B. Kim found that customer happiness is influenced by service quality, long-term relationships and relationship advantages, and customer satisfaction and trust [19]. According to C.Randhawa, a model he developed expands on Yee and Faziharudean's thesis that service quality, preserved value, trust, habit, reputation, and servicescape affect customer satisfaction [20][21]. Considering all these points, efforts have been made to develop an effective prediction model to predict whether the customer will retain or churn and its impact on company profitability considering factors affecting customer satisfaction. Because customer retention will vary depending on the identified factors affecting for customer satisfaction. Typically, the service center will suggest the next service date based on the kilometers traveled. However, customers often forget, or it may be changed depending on the type of used engine oil and the vehicle's condition. As technology advances on a daily basis, progressing with technology is more beneficial for any industry. As a solution, machine learning methods were chosen to predict the next service date in the 'Servport' vehicle service management system using a proper dataset. Numerous variables can be used to predict the next scheduled service date. The primary factors include the type of service, the cost of the service, time taken for the service, the average vehicle usage, and the year the vehicle was manufactured. Additionally, the system was developed using a vehicle service history dataset from a reputed vehicle service center in Sri Lanka. After predicting the next service date, the system will notify customers via email of the service date and estimated price. Predicting the next service date benefits not just the consumer, but also the company. It may also be used as a sales technique to encourage customers to return for their next car servicing. Additionally, it results in forming a bond between the customer and the company. Vehicle repair shops are also seriously researching ways to cut down on idle time for their employees. The waste of raw materials must also be reduced. In addition, the raw materials used daily will have an impact. As a result, client satisfaction will be lowered. The magazine produced by the IEOM Society International stresses the importance of anticipating employee performance [22]. Predicting the future is becoming increasingly important in the modern corporate sector because of the rapid changes that affect even the most established structures and the need for precise and realistic measured values into the future. It is a sign of survival and the language of business in the world that forecasts are made. When predicting the future, forecasting is both art and science. The most frequently occurring variable is a person's desire for a product or service. The supply and pricing of a product can also play a role [23]. Predicting future values of variables under study is known as forecasting. Demand and price forecasting have been the subject of several investigations. Product pricing and demand are typically predicted using historical data. In Mauritius, prices were predicted but have since changed. Comparing the prediction results of different technologies demonstrated that the cost of these solutions might be pretty comparable. It was discovered that the critical algorithm and method could not classify and predict numerical values. According to the findings of this study, a small sample size did not yield good prediction precision. [24]. Considerations such as these must be considered before a company selects a forecasting strategy that works best for it. Qualitative, time series, causal, and simulation forecasting approaches are examples of this method [25]. Time series analysis relies on the features of the demand time series to anticipate accurately. Stable and periodic patterns in transition curves resulted in high predicting accuracies; irregular patterns resulted in lower forecasting accuracy. [26].";

      " <h2>RESEARCH GAP</h2> Many service centers exist in Sri Lanka, yet there are numerous causes for their clients' unhappiness with their services. The establishment of a business process execution strategy would enable automobile service stations to successfully execute their operations while meeting the expectations of their customers and decreasing service expenses to give superior service. Increased customer satisfaction and an increase in the number of consumers may result from this. It has increased the company's revenue during the last few years. When a car servicing facility is trying to give a high quality of service at a reasonable price, it is necessary to identify the business process execution challenges occurring. Our approach increases customer satisfaction while also enhancing the profitability of our client's organization. In Sri Lanka, there is no such thing as an employee's efficiency based on their skill set, as there is no standard method for assessing it. Additionally, there is no established method for assigning work to staff. The following conclusion was made after examining the work of earlier researchers. There was no effective system for calculating the efficiency of individual employees in the service business. When allocating work, it is typical to disregard an employee's capabilities. There was no structure in place for allocating jobs in the service industry. In Sri Lanka, most service stations are manually operated. Service quality is one of the most important aspects in all services that clients demand. High and unique qualityâ¯service isâ¯a surefire method to acquire customers and keep them for a long time. Moreover, it enables to increase customer retention rates and number of loyalty customers. According to findings, even though there are quite a few numbers of research related to the customer retention prediction, there were no previous study conducted to predict customer retention in a vehicle service centers in Sri Lanka based on the factors affecting for customer retention. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the accuracy of different prediction methods used in previous researchers will be applicable to predict customer retention and loyalty of vehicle service centers in Sri Lanka. Graphical user interface, application, ExcelDescription automatically generatedIn the 8th International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM 2013), a journal article proposed that they planned to work on different data belongs to different countries. This clearly indicates that the prediction results of existing customers and churn customers of another country, cannot be applied and get useful results from a leading vehicle service center in Sri Lanka [24]. Therefore, the vehicle service providers need a plan to utilize their resources to provide a better standard quality service for a reasonable price for the customers. The issue is the frequency of customers vary in different time periods of the year and it affects the performance and profitability of the company [9]. In some months there may be high customer demand for vehicle services and in some months, it may be quite less. Thus, it results in fluctuation of the demand for resources resulting in underutilization of resources in some instances and loss of sales in some instances of the company. The issue is that the company does not know whether a particular customer will return in the future. Also, the customer churn rate and reasons behind them. Besides it directly affects the profitability of the company. The literature review demonstrates that present solutions for automating processes in vehicle service centers are inefficient in meeting the requirements of modern customer demands. The majority of systems preserve just customer data, and the prediction of the next service date is novel. It has been unable to locate any system that predicts and notifies the next service date to the relevant customers. With worldwide trends and the effect of information technology on the vehicle serviceâ¯industry, it is apparent that vehicle service stations must keep up with modern industry trends and facilitate customers in the most efficient manner possible. As shown by the vehicle serviceâ¯industry's effect of machine learning and other expert systems, it is simpler to use such methodologies in local systems to deliver a great service to customers. By examining existing systems for the vehicle serviceâ¯industry, it was determined that there is currently no system or platform in Sri Lanka that predicts the next service date and notifies relevant consumers through email. By using such a system, customers who are ready to plan their next vehicle servicing quickly and confidently will be able to relieve their pain point. The literature review, existing systems in the Sri Lankan automobile industry that assist with product demand and pricing are unable to satisfy the demands of modern forecasting methodologies. Most of the systems simply meet product demand. It hasn't been able to discover a method that will help the corporation estimate product demand, quantity, and pricing, as well as the overall cost of future consumer products. With global trends and the overcome of information technology traction in the automobile industry, it is clear that to attract a larger customer base to the Sri Lankan automobile industry, Sri Lanka must keep up with modern industry trends and provide the most effective service to automobile companies. As can be seen, Artificial Intelligence and other expert systems have a significant impact on the car business, thus it is more practical to use such approaches in local systems to give a pleasurable service to the worldwide vehicle sector. It has been proven that there is no existing system or platform in Sri Lanka that provides an advanced machine learning based product demand and price forecasting methodology to estimate future consumer product quantity and cost allocation by studying the existing systems available for the automobile sector. Implementing such a method will alleviate the pain point experienced by vehicle service stations that want to manage their monthly costs and supply chain in a more efficient and optimistic manner.

    "<h2>METHODOLOGY</h2> Customer retention is a crucial strategy to improve a company's profitability in any industry. Servicing cost of current loyal customers is likely to be lower than acquiring and servicing a new customer. The challenge is to identify the loyal customer segment of any company to drive sales promotion activities to a target customer base without wasting company valuable resources to drive optimum results of the investments. As in the case of any industry, customers in the vehicle service industry look for better quality service at a reasonable price. Therefore, the study aims to introduce an ICT solution to address these challenges and satisfy the needsof the customers and the company. The approach taken here is to get the frequency of customer retention and, using that frequency, identify whether that customer will return again or whether that customer is churned and predict customer behavior percentage-wise impact on vehicle service center's profitability using selected machine learning techniques with the use of a customer data set. Finally, the machine learning technique with the highest accuracy was selected and finetune the algorithm to improve the accuracy rate further. The customer dataset used in this research component is obtained through one of the leading vehicle service centers in Sri Lanka and made the necessary changes. The data set contains 554 customer records. The data set mainly consists of customers' personal data, service price and the factors affecting for customer satisfaction. As mentioned above, a literature survey was done to identify the factors affecting customer satisfaction both in the vehicle service sector and in other sectors. From the identified factors, the most related factors that affect customer satisfaction in the vehicle service sector were selected. Therefore, the distance from the customer's home to the vehicle service center, service quality, response time and customer service were identified as the factors affecting customer satisfaction in vehicle service stations in Sri Lanka. When considering the employee efficiency prediction, using the decision tree model, the goal is to estimate staff efficiency accurately. Create a decision tree to help the service center manager determine which employees are the most effective at tasks. According to the table 2 of input parameters, the decision tree algorithm examines the historical data set (3 inputs and one label). Before entering the data into this algorithm, the employee number and the time taken by the employee to perform the task are divided into two parts x and y (x-time spent yemployee number) and entered into the graph, comparing it with the relevant task number. The data then calculates the average time taken by each employee to perform the task, then sorts the data from low to high and identifies the employee who spent the least amount of time on the task at hand. The data coming through the algorithm is categorized based on the quality of the work done again. Employees classified in this way are then checked to see if they are attached to a particular job or are assigned to a job that suits them best. Another main aim of this study is to forecast sales demand and price. The goal of this function is to use the ARIMA time series forecasting model to provide an accurate estimate of average fare. The ARIMA model was created to forecast sales demand and pricing reliably. The Sales product data collection contains monthly sales statistics for the past nine years. Date, Product Quantity, and Price Forecasting Factors make up the majority of the data collection. A literature review was undertaken, as previously stated, to establish the factors that influence product demand and price forecasting. From the discovered factors, the ones that had the major impact on forecasting demand and price were selected. Consequently, the date, product demand quantity, price, substitute product price, and production cost per unit were identified as factors affecting the demand and price forecasting of Sri Lankan vehicle service station products.";
